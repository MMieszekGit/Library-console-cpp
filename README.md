# 📚 Library Console (C++)

A **console-based library management system** written in modern C++(20).  
This project represents the **core version** of a larger multi-variant system (future REST API and GUI versions planned).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add new books (ID, title, author, publication year, number of copies)
- Display all books in the system
- Search books by title, author, or both
- Add and remove users with validation
- Prevent user deletion when they have active loans
- Track book availability and prevent loaning when no copies remain
- Basic input validation:
  - Ensures numeric values are within valid ranges
  - Disallows empty strings for critical inputs
  - Checks for basic email validity (`@` required)
- Data consistency enforcement across repositories
- Separation of logic through clear **service**, **model**, and **repository** layers

### 🔑 Key Components

- **Book** — stores metadata about library books (ID, title, author, year, copies)
- **User** — manages user data (ID, name, email)
- **Loan** — links users to borrowed books and due dates
- **LibraryService** — core logic handling validation and communication between repositories
- **Repositories** — in-memory collections of `Book`, `User`, and `Loan` objects
- **Enums** — define consistent return codes (e.g. `AddResult::Success`, `RemoveResult::InvalidName`)
- **Validation utilities** — protect against invalid inputs and maintain data integrity

## 🎯 Example Usage

Interactive console menu:

```
=== LIBRARY ===

1. Add Book
2. List All Books
3. Search Book

4. Add User
5. Remove User
6. List All Users

7. Borrow Book
8. Return Book

0. Exit
```

Sample book input:

```
ID: 100
Title: 1984
Author: George Orwell
Year: 1949
Copies: 4
```

Sample user input:

```
ID: 5
Name: Alice Smith
Email: alice.smith@example.com
```

## ⚙️ Installation & Running

### 🪟 Windows (Visual Studio)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MMieszekGit/Library-console-cpp.git
   ```
2. Open `Library-console.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Set `Library.cpp` as the startup file (if not already)
4. Run the project (**Ctrl + F5**)

### 🐧 Linux / macOS (CLI)

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 Library.cpp -o library_app
./library_app
```

> Note: Adjust include paths for `models/`, `interfaces/`, and other folders if needed.

## 🧠 Technologies & Concepts

- **C++20 standard**
- **STL containers** (`std::vector`, `std::string`)
- **Object-Oriented Design**
- **Repository pattern**
- **Encapsulation & Polymorphism**
- **Input validation & error handling**
- **Separation of concerns** (models, logic, UI)
- **Console UI** for interaction

## 🧩 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Complete loan system with return and due-date logic
- [ ] CSV/JSON-based data persistence
- [ ] REST API version using C++ web libraries
- [ ] GUI version using Qt or ImGui
- [ ] i18n multilingual support
- [ ] Unit testing with Catch2 or GoogleTest
